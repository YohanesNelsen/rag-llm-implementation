"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI should start by saying I had never really played a survival-type game until Palworld. They always seemed so out of my skill range and so daunting. I saw the first public videos of Palworld in its old engine and thought, ""Ha guns and little Mon's interesting."" Honestly, I didn't think it would even make it to early access. Well, look at me, so I was proved wrong. It launched in a new graphic style and with a lot of visual improvements and big upgrades. I started and started solo and was instantly hooked. The game walks you through the learning process in such a nice elegant way. I never felt like anything was impossible or out of my reach if I didn't just put some effort into it. I have almost 500 days on my server and 300hrs.

"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWGreat game nice to see it gets updated.Though the CONTENT right now is really limited.I love the Game play loop of just discovering the world, once you get your base up and running.I love survival games, I never really played monster capture games that much.But it was nice to see how they incorporated these 2 genre pretty well.There's are still some bugs here and there but It's still in early access, they do fix it and send an update patch whenever they see a bug that is not an intended feature.Problem with the game right now in early access is that the world right now is kind of empty.Yes there are dungeons to beat, Towers to defeat, and Pal bosses to capture or fight.But the map is too big and there's so little things going on on the map.Suggestions:""Content for Discovery""The villages and Towns don't have anything going on in them.I suggest to come up with a Dev team writers that will flesh out a story on every town/region or factions with town people or characters giving you quests. like capture specific pals for trade and you get rewarded with Key items. Or given access to a dungeon or a certain area. Maybe an underground city or some floating islands, or the terrain change if you fight and defeat certain Pal boss.Like what if one of the giant skeletons lying around get's revived (by PGRU) and when defeated turns out it was covering dungeon underneath it. Then we would explore that underwater dungeon and it's all water themed pals in it.Or what if Free Pal Alliance angered a giant Pal that caused the forests to over grow, and changed the landscape of a certain region. Where then the Pals in these forest became stronger and much faster.Or have the Brothers of the Eternal Pyre Accidentally Summon or Disturbed a giant Pal that was sleeping in the volcano upon waking up it caused the volcano to erupt that also changed the landscape, like the Lava levels rising and maybe causing certain areas to move unlocking cave caverns.There's also a possibility of a Giant Pal coming out of the ground in the dessert and changing the landscape having caves underneath to explore.There's so many possibilities.There's also different factions and option to add certain factions like people who are fighting against Free Pal Alliance, they could be living on tree houses,Opposite of Brothers of The Eternal Pyre. People who just like to surf or swim with their Pals.Or the total opposite of Free Pal Alliance who uses the Pals for mining in Caves.There's some ruins here and there, make some random events on certain locations to make it interesting. Make up some lore like there would be a ghost related pal that visits one of the church in certain nights or like in full moon.I really wish they flesh out the story more, it doesn't have to be voice acted or good animated cut scenes.Have some weather or celestial cycles that affects certain Pals.i.e.Rain would make fire pals weak and water pals much stronger.Full moon would make dark pals restless and much powerful.Make the Swamp or certain areas misty.""Quality of Life""I like how there's a lot of Quality of Life features that makes the game more accessible.> Have the option so that a server can have at least 1 person sleeping and it skips the night.Though I wondered if they should add a building for gathering Items or hunting materials. You would assign pals that would go hunt/gather the assigned materials and each pals would have specific materials they can hunt or gather. They wouldn't need to be animated or anything just a slot in the menu of some sort.This way there's other ways to farm items, Instead of having a ranch with all your pals that could cause lags you would have pals that are just assigned to gather those materials overtime and depending on their gathering level or stats they can get as many as those item or not. This also makes use of those powerful pals we have but can't be in the party or bases.",Recommended,3237,55.3 hrs on record,Posted: April 5
