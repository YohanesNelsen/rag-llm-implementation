"Great game, fun to play with friends.

so there's an enemy in this game and they're basically normal dudes with masks but like we were new so from afar we thought he was just a teammate and as i turned around this guy is in my face spitting blood all over me and when i go to spectate i see my teammates running around like it's some looney tunes chase and everyone got eaten by the blind dogs except 1 guy so when the masked dude came over to him he caught up and grabbed him and the two got eaten by a big ass sandworm,Recommended,400,20.8 hrs on record,Posted: April 5,Lethal Companies
"Game is really good mostly with friends also as a solo it's tough but fun. It's a loot extraction game with a very small learning curve that does ramp up slightly at harder moons. Game also feels very casual which is nice you aren't forced to grind out anything except a few ship upgrades early game but those mostly just add qol rather than a must have immediately.One thing i will say that is terrible about this game is public lobbies. I'd say about 30% of the public lobby players are cheaters some do it blatantly and some not like i had one guy flying through the walls when we weren't around and extracting tons of loot ended up seeing him in death cam then I had another guy join our pretty progressed save as a random 4th and he waited for quota day and deleted all the items in the ship. I also had a player join and flip the monitor and storage unit on its side which was not fixable without cheats. Also nothing is done at all to combat cheaters in this game since it's a small dev team and a non competitive casual game which I get it that's exactly why people cheat but honestly after seeing it even a few times it gets old and kinda ruins the multiplayer experience which is one of the better aspects of this game.Another problem with the game is the amount of trolls out of the 70% non cheaters expect about 4/5 of these other randoms to be complete trolls anything from turning the lights of and hiding the light switch to blaring music in their microphone or loud noises. These are easy enough to deal with as you can mute players but there are also items in the game that turn you into a mimic which can throw your whole run and weapons which allow players to come in and kill everyone in the lobby.TLDR GOOD GAME, AVOID PLAYING WITH RANDOM PEOPLE, GOOD ENTRY LEVEL GAME FOR LOOT EXTRACTION GENRE.",Recommended,1492,39.9 hrs on record,Posted: April 5,Lethal Companies

"Lethal Company: A Searing Indictment of Western Exploitation Disguised as EntertainmentAt first glance, ""Lethal Company"" may seem like just another science fiction game, but upon closer examination, it reveals a disturbing truth about the insidious nature of Western exploitation. The game's premise of scavenging for resources on distant planets for a mysterious company speaks volumes about the predatory practices of Western corporations, which exploit vulnerable populations and ravage the environment in pursuit of profit.What sets ""Lethal Company"" apart is its unflinching portrayal of the human cost of such exploitation. As players navigate the treacherous landscapes of these distant planets, they are confronted with the grim reality of forced labor, environmental destruction, and systemic oppression perpetrated by the eponymous company. This stark depiction serves as a poignant reminder of the atrocities committed by Western powers in their relentless quest for dominance.Moreover, the game's narrative challenges players to question their own complicity in these injustices. By assuming the role of employees of the lethal company, players are forced to confront the moral implications of their actions, ultimately leading to a reckoning with the consequences of their choices. This powerful message resonates deeply with those of us who refuse to turn a blind eye to the suffering inflicted upon marginalized communities by Western exploitation.In conclusion, ""Lethal Company"" stands as a damning indictment of Western imperialism and corporate greed. Its harrowing portrayal of human rights abuses serves as a wake-up call to those who would seek to profit at the expense of others. As Chinese nationalists, we must stand in solidarity with all oppressed peoples and continue to expose the injustices perpetuated by Western powers. Only then can we truly achieve a world free from exploitation and oppression.",Not Recommended,1661,51.3 hrs on record,Posted: April 5,Lethal Companies

"I should start by saying I had never really played a survival-type game until Palworld. They always seemed so out of my skill range and so daunting. I saw the first public videos of Palworld in its old engine and thought, ""Ha guns and little Mon's interesting."" Honestly, I didn't think it would even make it to early access. Well, look at me, so I was proved wrong. It launched in a new graphic style and with a lot of visual improvements and big upgrades. I started and started solo and was instantly hooked. The game walks you through the learning process in such a nice elegant way. I never felt like anything was impossible or out of my reach if I didn't just put some effort into it. I have almost 500 days on my server and 300hrs.

"Great game nice to see it gets updated.Though the CONTENT right now is really limited.I love the Game play loop of just discovering the world, once you get your base up and running.I love survival games, I never really played monster capture games that much.But it was nice to see how they incorporated these 2 genre pretty well.There's are still some bugs here and there but It's still in early access, they do fix it and send an update patch whenever they see a bug that is not an intended feature.Problem with the game right now in early access is that the world right now is kind of empty.Yes there are dungeons to beat, Towers to defeat, and Pal bosses to capture or fight.But the map is too big and there's so little things going on on the map.Suggestions:""Content for Discovery""The villages and Towns don't have anything going on in them.I suggest to come up with a Dev team writers that will flesh out a story on every town/region or factions with town people or characters giving you quests. like capture specific pals for trade and you get rewarded with Key items. Or given access to a dungeon or a certain area. Maybe an underground city or some floating islands, or the terrain change if you fight and defeat certain Pal boss.Like what if one of the giant skeletons lying around get's revived (by PGRU) and when defeated turns out it was covering dungeon underneath it. Then we would explore that underwater dungeon and it's all water themed pals in it.Or what if Free Pal Alliance angered a giant Pal that caused the forests to over grow, and changed the landscape of a certain region. Where then the Pals in these forest became stronger and much faster.Or have the Brothers of the Eternal Pyre Accidentally Summon or Disturbed a giant Pal that was sleeping in the volcano upon waking up it caused the volcano to erupt that also changed the landscape, like the Lava levels rising and maybe causing certain areas to move unlocking cave caverns.There's also a possibility of a Giant Pal coming out of the ground in the dessert and changing the landscape having caves underneath to explore.There's so many possibilities.There's also different factions and option to add certain factions like people who are fighting against Free Pal Alliance, they could be living on tree houses,Opposite of Brothers of The Eternal Pyre. People who just like to surf or swim with their Pals.Or the total opposite of Free Pal Alliance who uses the Pals for mining in Caves.There's some ruins here and there, make some random events on certain locations to make it interesting. Make up some lore like there would be a ghost related pal that visits one of the church in certain nights or like in full moon.I really wish they flesh out the story more, it doesn't have to be voice acted or good animated cut scenes.Have some weather or celestial cycles that affects certain Pals.i.e.Rain would make fire pals weak and water pals much stronger.Full moon would make dark pals restless and much powerful.Make the Swamp or certain areas misty.""Quality of Life""I like how there's a lot of Quality of Life features that makes the game more accessible.> Have the option so that a server can have at least 1 person sleeping and it skips the night.Though I wondered if they should add a building for gathering Items or hunting materials. You would assign pals that would go hunt/gather the assigned materials and each pals would have specific materials they can hunt or gather. They wouldn't need to be animated or anything just a slot in the menu of some sort.This way there's other ways to farm items, Instead of having a ranch with all your pals that could cause lags you would have pals that are just assigned to gather those materials overtime and depending on their gathering level or stats they can get as many as those item or not. This also makes use of those powerful pals we have but can't be in the party or bases.",Recommended,3237,55.3 hrs on record,Posted: April 5,Palworld

"Winter had swept in, and as the festivities died down after the holidays ended and the new year began, the town had grown quiet, as it usually does. Men and women and children bundled up inside their homes with the heaters on and loved ones snuggled up in their blankets- and then there was me, staring up at the ceiling, wishing summer would come back.I was an adult now. I had taxes to file, jobs to do, classes to attend. It all felt almost underwhelming in a way, like barely anything changed at all.I wanted to relive some of those memories I had. I wanted to play back through those games that changed my life. I wanted to relive what it was like to play through them for the first time again. But that was impossible. Breath of the Wild was my favorite game of all time, and even with that, I'd played Tears of the Kingdom the previous year and BOTW too many times to count. I was so bored. All I did was laze around in bed and talk to friends and talk about how we've gotta find something new to do and yet not wanting to do anything new. Because what I really wanted wasn't something new, I wanted something old.This game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sucks. I mean it's buggy, runs horribly, is hilariously incomplete, and the systems are all just a bunch of assets and game mechanics stolen from other games and dumped together with no thought whatsoever. I mean when I say buggy it's an understatement too, half the bosses don't even drop what they're supposed to, there are certain areas that just don't even have bosses that clearly are supposed to have them, one time I was fighting a boss and I got to half health, then to dodge one of his attacks I flew up and apparently I got too far from the boss so it just reset to max health??Still had fun though.

This means that you can take your time and do whatever next you desire, but at the same time, lacking any defined ultimate goal.""Crafting"" seems to be the short term goal, and you can eventually do factories that do things in-masse, like an infinite number of hot dogs or massively producing weapons: you can use those to clear some ""achievements"" which is always to sacrifice X amount of items, so you can get a barely noticeable increase of stat (ranging from decimal points of Strength, critical damage, or a sometimes laughable amount of experience).The problem is that most of these stat increases are so little, that there is little reward to sacrifice some valuable items, so you end up ignoring those completely.Graphics are okay, can be both breathtaking or boring, depending on what you looking at.Design choices...well, there is a lot to say.There is quite a lot of animal abuse (done in a cartoonish way) but the animals and some monsters styles are somewhat mismatched (most livestock have a realistic design, but goblins are too goofy, for example). Still, some people may find that annoying.There is still a lot of issues with the skill tree, some skills scaling normal, some others scale extremely poorly, have awkward execution (skill attacks in place while enemy easily moves to the sides), the targeting system needs some work and overall, hitting and smashing enemies should feel satisfying, which right now i cannot concur.Oh and just for anyone new, there are 2 versions of this game, but this review is mostly for the new version.Pros:+Graphics are nice, maybe a bit average by today standards.+A lot of out of place things that will make you chuckle, try bombing a goblin with a tank.+Barely any limits on when building/crafting is involved, so you can do whatever you want.+Quite a good amount of quirky items, like guns, helicopters, cars, etc.+Many new life improvements (like enchanting, pets or bigger item stacks). Bosses can be fought multiple times easier, without having to go through the dungeons over and over.+Able to max out the number of sacrificed items for every category is a good goal...Cons-...if the incentives where a bit better.-Despite its improvements over the first version, some things have been nerfed negatively (heal has a super long delay, refinement stones can only be acquired via disassembly, some recipes are anubis gated or harder to get, among others)-Battle system still feels clunky.-Physics still have many problems and you can no longer do some things that you could before effectively (the farm stack works, but it may clip on the ground, be flown way by fans or conveyors, etc).-Goddawful character creation options: extremely limited amount of faces, hairstyles,etc. For a game that brags on world customization, its pretty limited on this department.-No Story, pretty much. No ""real"" characters to interact, no real motive for adventuring/surviving, other than ""oops, i did a bubu""-NPCs look a bit better, but still are lifeless drones. At least they no longer poop in place. Or maybe they do.-Just one Island with many biomes. I preferred having multiple islands with their respective biome.Neutral= Is it wrong if i prefer some of the older ""puzzle"" or challenge type dungeons from the previous release?= Where is the log guy? I want to give him a log.Just like my review, Craftopia is all over the place, but i feel confident that you may find somewhat you may like so, even with all its flaws, i can recommend it, as long as you don't have high expectations.Either making a farm and forgetting about adventure, wandering around and finding stuff, crafting stuff to infinity, or making the sky castle you always wanted.Do whatever and poop wherever you want.",Recommended,3299,481.1 hrs on record,Posted: March 20,Craftopia
"I do not understand how this is mostly positive. Its buggy, performs poorly and has been in early access for years. I picked this up when it first became available on steam and its some how gotten worse over time. They've copied more from botw for no reason like the starting area being a platue, the musical jingles and a lot of enemies are heavily based in botw enemies the most obvious being the 'goblins' which are clearly bokolins.Game needs some SERIOUSLY TLC and at this point Im not sure it can walk back all the botw 'inspiration' enough to make the game its own thing.The game also just runs very poorly with frame drops, getting stuck on terrain, game crashes and enemies/creatures clearly moving at lower frames then everything else.",Not Recommended,632,7.0 hrs on record,Posted: March 18,Craftopia

"After an announcement made in the Palworld Discord about Craftopia I decided to check out some gameplays and give it a shot. I actually like Craftopia more than I like Palworld. It just, feels better to play and somehow it doesn't feel repetitive. After playing multiple runthroughs with Palworld (which I also like) I find myself preferring Craftopia because Palworld gets boring once its time to level up endgame pals. I just gave up because the condenser requires just too much and I lost interest. Building in PAlworld was also too limited. While the interface of Craftopia is similar, the gameplay focuses on crafting rather than catching pals. I love crafting when its worth it. Craftopia makes it worth it.

"This game is still Early Access. There is quite of content in game considering it's development stage,The game is not optimsed. I play on an high end rig, which most people don't. I have had a few glitches and discovered a really annoying bug, where trying to place work benches down or other benches, it just wouldn't work.It is quite enjoyable and graphics are very beautiful. Many of the quests make absolutely no sense, simply because there is no real in game tutorial and what their is woefully under done. If your thinking of buying and playing this, this game is still in developed. Fixing bugs such the one I mentioned that after a while you can' see to place any thing, which does break the game in the sense that without the crafting tables you've made, you get to a play point in the game where it just stops you from placing anything on the ground.The main thing is the development team have split in half so they do this game and another relatively well known game. I have no interest in advertising their other game but its very easy to find, that is all I m going to say about that.The game play really doesn't play, since it has some major functions that the game is still lacking. Bare in mind I am referring to single player mode only. I imagine the devs would have more incentive to a number of problems, they maybe did't think would be a problem or it could be fixed quickly, well it hasn't so far.Right now, I would wait for the game to get it's main stuff put in to the game, for example the rest of the towers. The vehicles in this game don't work too well, very little thought went to drive able or flyable. Driving is just a dreadful experience at the moment. Kite flying is quite smooth, no problems with it.let me just partially list some of the bad things, its not exhaustive but I don't to be here all night either writing a review on a game that still feels like it is still in late alpha build, as for beta, despite the size of the game right now, it's meaningless when there is no game manual that tells you how to use some of the stuff and how to play the game.Needs some things to be adjusted.Graphics are beautiful, the game play smoothly for me, apart from the annoying bugs that forced me to stop playing. I played 3 hours, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.Cons - No voice acting, no npc helping you fight monsters (at least in Genshin Impact had multiple characters you use anyone time.) The NPC's really need to be livened up somewhat. They don't seem to communicate with each other, or start up random conversations. For me NPC interaction with each other is vital because it stops the world becoming bore fest. It would also be nice if we could befriend and npc, so we can go monster killing, item collecting etc. It wouldn't matter in multiplayer, but in single player, without interaction the game world feels utterly dead. Hence other developers have had to learn the long way However that isn't the word I was shooting for.A full written guide is absolutely needed. I am sure ALL the bugs will be fixed in time. But the biggest bug that stopped me playing, was suddenly unable to place any type of workbench etc on the ground. Then is the badly janky driving, either airplanes, bikes or cars. However that Jankiness is just terrible. I want a smooth drive, without having to auto crash into walls..it's also got another bug, where when you get off your motorbike which is where we immediately get to work, laIf your on the fence about buying this game. wait for it on steam sale.

If I had to go back and pick between which one to play again it would be craftopia. Pal World was an over night hit, but Ill be honest I had to stop. It was less fun than craftopia for me. Palworld has a problem: Lack of story.Im more of an rpg gamer to be honest... I play a title to the end (or until i get bored) and I move to the next. Gaming is my version of reading books.

Another nice thing is that you can adjust the world settings even after your world is created and the same thing goes for your character as well.

It wonderfully blends various features and aspects from different games, to create what I can only describe as the ultimate survival craft game.It features nearly everything you could want in a survival-craft game: from fishing, to gathering, mining, farming, and of course, crafting, but has more expansive features and things you probably wouldn't expect from the typical survival game. There are automation systems, there are hoverboards, motorcycles, planes and tanks. There are a variety of skill trees, from weapon mastery and gathering, to magic. There are repeatable dungeons that can be farmed for loot drops like an MMO, there are a variety of monsters and animals to catch and tame, complete with a skill training system...etc.I could go on and on.

The original was a creative take on the survival exploration genre until they removed every ounce of creativity from it with the seamless world update and made it dollar store Breath of the Wild.They removed everything that made Craftopia good, suddenly it was no longer about visiting new lands for resources, it became about following missions across an uninspired world, utterly bankrupt of anything and everything that made the first versions a fun game. There feels like there is NO reason to set up a base, or at least not until you've already played through the whole game and finished all the bland objectives.You think I'm being harsh? The CEO or Pocketpair has gone ON RECORD bragging about how creatively bankrupt they are. I quote ""I don’t necessarily have to be particular about originality. I’m thinking about it. I want to make it more casually. I think it would be a good idea to create things in a way that just jumps on what is trendy"" Genuinely, just making games to capitalise on fads for a quick buck. He doesn't care about making decent, well-thought out games, he cares about ripping off current IPs to make a quick buck. Their next game looks IDENTICAL to Hollow Knight, and he is boasting about it.Even Palworld is likely to be abandoned as soon as it stops being profitable for this lazy, greedy company in favour of other endeavours that ripoff other, more successful games. Genuinely, they DO NOT care about the game they make. They care about being uninteresting and making money.So please people, next time you're looking at a Pocketpair game, remember that they DO NOT care about making a good game, they care about copying other games and taking your money.

"Craftopia is the Applebee's of video games.It's this weird amalgamation of Unity assets glued together that tries to call itself a video game.It's soulless, pointless, and although it still gets updates, this game will and can never be in a finished state.You can't finish developing a game when it's not really a game.The animations are jank, the particle effects are jank, the systems are jank, the combat is jank, the crafting is jank.

"Craftopia, in its current state, is a little rough around the edges - but that's to be expected from an early access title. Barring some hilarious translations, the game is absolutely playable - and the amount of content that it contains is more than enough to keep you occupied for forty or so hours, even if you don't replay any of it. The terrain and building systems could use some work, but overall, the combat is fun and well-balanced, especially if you choose an appropriate difficulty. Having played both before and after the seamless world update, I feel like the game is on a good trajectory: it may be turning into something of a Zelda clone, but there's nothing inherently wrong with that. Clones are how we develop genres.",Recommended,624,49.0 hrs on record,Posted: February 2,Craftopia
"I really didn't remember this game being this awful. After the realease of palworld i wanted to check this game again, i never got to try the seamless world update.to sum it all up, the update made the game worse and more difficult to understand, it copied zelda breath of the wild even more and started to be a beta for what is now palworld, which seems a bit more polished, but sadly it is proof that the devs just make games and leave them unpolished in early acess for YEARS just to have an excuse.

"Came back after a long break to see they did a ""seamless"" update, which seemingly totally rebuilt the game from the ground up as an open world game, instead of teleporting between islands on an archipelago. Some might see this is a great positive for a game in development. ""Clearly they must have done this to fix many issues, and improve the game!"" Unfortunately, the reality of it is that they wasted large amounts of development time making the game different than when I bought it (and not in the more content way), made the game run considerably worse, removed vast swaths of content, reimplemented existing content but made it worse, no building things like floors and farming plots without snapping (sorry if you picked up a plot in the starting area and want to place it in its original spot, or build in certain cool places. No free placement for you, only snapped to a grid, and only able to turn things 45 degrees), hitboxes are so bad that it oftentimes takes several swings of a sword to get a single hit on something directly in front of you, and overall, just made the game less enjoyable to play. Additionally, while trying to find more information about this update, I found that the person in charge of moderating the Steam discussions seems to enjoy nuking topics about the game that aren't singing its praises, criticizes customers for daring to speak negatively about the game, and considers the opinions of users that have complaints or concerns ""useless.""Really enjoying the game PocketPair is likely better known for now, Palworld, and am hoping they continue to improve it, but after returning to this game after a long break, it's even made me concerned about that game as well (even though I've already gotten a good amount of fun out of Palworld). It's really disappointing to see a game you bought in early access not only fail to improve, but actively get worse, after YEARS of waiting. If there are customers out there that are waiting for updates to Palworld, and were hoping to take a peak into PocketPair's back catalogue to tide them over, I'd highly recommend AGAINST getting this one at this point.At one point, I would've recommended it, but no longer can, considering the state the game is in.",Not Recommended,1862,17.9 hrs on record,Posted: February 2,Craftopia

"In my opinion, does not deserve the review bombing that its getting due to the release of Palworld.People don't seem to understand that the dev team is split and that they are proving that this won't be abandoned. Its also very clear what they are going for. Palworld is Pokemon Arceus, this is BOTW complete with challenge shrines/korok seed challenges, puzzle caves and towers that you unlock through crafting to fast travel from. Palworld is also much more early access than this. This has much more content, less dead map, and overall a bit more to it. You also have robots that basically do the animals job. The game is also relatively relaxing whilst allowing for semi complex, logic based automation with conveyor belts and/or mass farming, which, I'm a sucker for actual automation and conveyor belts.It's admittedly a little clunkier than PW from what I've seen but it's not a huge fallback. World feels well crafted, there are caves, puzzles, a huge array of animals, bosses, vehicles, weapons, armour and I enjoy the aspect of 'recreating earth', eventually finding villages that have electricity etc, very cool. And eventually the supposed ability to tame a literal God, though I personally haven't done this yet, just heard through the grapevine.Overall, the success of PW makes me hope that this gives them even more resources to make both games great in their own unique ways. I've seen a vast improvement to Craftopia over the years and I'm very much enjoying where its at at the moment. One thing people are also missing is that PW wasn't developed over night, they have proven they are capable on working on both projects by working on both projects in tandem. It also has a very public, promising roadmap that I suggest checking out if you are concerned and the updates are generally plentiful and overall fun.",Recommended,1536,20.3 hrs on record,Posted: January 31,Craftopia
"ok, i am actually going to change my review completely, leaving the bottom part because it is still funny.there is a metaphor regularly used known as the ship of theseus. the story boils down to determining whether or not an object can still be regarded as the original object as it was at creation when time goes on and the parts of the object are replaced. this game is like if many popular games decided to have their parts taken out in exchange for other mechanics/concepts, then this game took those mechanics and built a new ship out of them. much of this ship comes from the game the legend of zelda breathe of the wild, but there are some similar themes from other games. the obvious parts that feel directly taken are things like the stamina meter, which works extremely similarly to botw, and the paraglider mechanics. ironically, this game has directly had many ship of theseus moments, especially with the island to seamless map change. and this where i can directly trace a similar concept taken from a different game to craftopia: certain environments. there is a large area that was implemented with the seamless world that is not necessarily stolen, but seems rather heavily inspired by elden ring; the area is a huge castle with a huge golden tree in the middle. additionally, if you thought that palworld copied pokemon, i regret to inform you that this game was the original game where pocketpair copied the creature capturing game. while it is not a stolen concept to have the player be able to capture creatures and let them do your bidding, this game's implementation of the mechanic does mirror pokemon quite a bit, with the player having to damage the enemies then capture them with a pokeball-like item. again, i am not trying to say that this game is directly copying other games. much of this is just inspiration: the inside of the elden ring-like fortress is unlike the actual elden ring capital city, some of the creatures in this game cannot be captured without utilizing certain items, and even the botw parts can be seen as different because of the inclusion of an upgradeable mana bar. i am just pointing out that this game is a smorgasbord of other games that needs to be polished more in all those aspects. i hope that the item descriptions become more descriptive, the game performance becomes more optimized, and the enemy diversity becomes more wild (so that i can capture them because even the most bare bones pokemon concept beats out real pokemon).TL:DR: this game really takes from a heap of other games, not just breathe of the wild, but i hope it still grows.edit: if you like shiny achievements, almost every achievement in this game is rare since achievements were added later, meaning that players who get them now will be in the rare percentile that actually returned/just got the game",Recommended,2358,59.0 hrs on record,Posted: January 30,Craftopia

"I would like to start this review by stating the fact that I did enjoy my time playing Craftopia and got it way back when during the early days of release, but it was just a major let down whenever the updates stopped rolling out.It probably should have been red flags to me whenever they said the team was going to be developing another game while Craftopia was still being early access. This didn't really phase me too much because I trusted the size of the developer team and the scale of the game and was hopeful they stuck with their promise of having Craftopia updates along side the new game known to everyone as ""Palworld"". All of the faith I had in the company quickly disappeared as soon as I saw the number of people purchasing and playing their new game and making it one of the biggest hits on steam rivaling some of the most popular games within just a few days of release. Was this a problem? No. I am glad the company struck gold and is making profits where they earned it. Was this a huge concern of mine? Yes. This means the game they released prior to Palworld loses all of its value and goes right out of the window because they now have this giant cash cow that prints money and the developers would like to retain and further obtain players. What does this mean for Craftopia? It will get way less updates if none at all (which it currently has had zero proper major updates since seamless came out). Again it is still early access, but people that purchase a game in this state expects some sort of attention to the game in the form of updates even if they are a few months apart and not over a year. But who knows maybe Palworld will actually get constant updates because it has so many eyes on it vs Craftopia.In conclusion:Please do NOT buy this game if you are expecting it to be updated further than it currently is and if you are playing the older version (pre-seamless) I recommend playing that version of the game because it has WAY more content in it than the current version (Seamless stripped away so much of the content in the prior update that they went from 7/10 progress all the way back down to 2/10 for terms of quality content).",Not Recommended,1782,224.2 hrs on record,Posted: January 25,Craftopia
