"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI loved the original Craftopia, however the seamless world update completely changed the game. Honestly, it looks and runs horrible now. The character creation is terrible and for some reason there is a dumb character outline glow. The movement and look just feels gross. I'm sad they ruined a fun little game and turns it into this.",Not Recommended,294,79.9 hrs on record,Posted: 3 April
"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWCrazy jank! Super glitchy movement, invisible walls all over the place (some which you hilariously can climb), not well optimized at all, shadows flicker to the extreme and you can see through terrain depending on camera orientation. Plus the story is outrageously bad! This was not at all what I expected, this feels like a very unfinished early alpha.",Not Recommended,312,0.3 hrs on record,Posted: 3 April
"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWWinter had swept in, and as the festivities died down after the holidays ended and the new year began, the town had grown quiet, as it usually does. Men and women and children bundled up inside their homes with the heaters on and loved ones snuggled up in their blankets- and then there was me, staring up at the ceiling, wishing summer would come back.I was an adult now. I had taxes to file, jobs to do, classes to attend. It all felt almost underwhelming in a way, like barely anything changed at all.I wanted to relive some of those memories I had. I wanted to play back through those games that changed my life. I wanted to relive what it was like to play through them for the first time again. But that was impossible. Breath of the Wild was my favorite game of all time, and even with that, I'd played Tears of the Kingdom the previous year and BOTW too many times to count. I was so bored. All I did was laze around in bed and talk to friends and talk about how we've gotta find something new to do and yet not wanting to do anything new. Because what I really wanted wasn't something new, I wanted something old.This game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sucks. I mean it's buggy, runs horribly, is hilariously incomplete, and the systems are all just a bunch of assets and game mechanics stolen from other games and dumped together with no thought whatsoever. I mean when I say buggy it's an understatement too, half the bosses don't even drop what they're supposed to, there are certain areas that just don't even have bosses that clearly are supposed to have them, one time I was fighting a boss and I got to half health, then to dodge one of his attacks I flew up and apparently I got too far from the boss so it just reset to max health??Still had fun though.

"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWCraftopia is an amusing riddle.Just like many ""Open World"" crafting/survival -esque games, there is barely any objective other than to wander around and armor yourself with whatever you want/can. This means that you can take your time and do whatever next you desire, but at the same time, lacking any defined ultimate goal.""Crafting"" seems to be the short term goal, and you can eventually do factories that do things in-masse, like an infinite number of hot dogs or massively producing weapons: you can use those to clear some ""achievements"" which is always to sacrifice X amount of items, so you can get a barely noticeable increase of stat (ranging from decimal points of Strength, critical damage, or a sometimes laughable amount of experience).The problem is that most of these stat increases are so little, that there is little reward to sacrifice some valuable items, so you end up ignoring those completely.Graphics are okay, can be both breathtaking or boring, depending on what you looking at.Design choices...well, there is a lot to say.There is quite a lot of animal abuse (done in a cartoonish way) but the animals and some monsters styles are somewhat mismatched (most livestock have a realistic design, but goblins are too goofy, for example). Still, some people may find that annoying.There is still a lot of issues with the skill tree, some skills scaling normal, some others scale extremely poorly, have awkward execution (skill attacks in place while enemy easily moves to the sides), the targeting system needs some work and overall, hitting and smashing enemies should feel satisfying, which right now i cannot concur.Oh and just for anyone new, there are 2 versions of this game, but this review is mostly for the new version.Pros:+Graphics are nice, maybe a bit average by today standards.+A lot of out of place things that will make you chuckle, try bombing a goblin with a tank.+Barely any limits on when building/crafting is involved, so you can do whatever you want.+Quite a good amount of quirky items, like guns, helicopters, cars, etc.+Many new life improvements (like enchanting, pets or bigger item stacks). Bosses can be fought multiple times easier, without having to go through the dungeons over and over.+Able to max out the number of sacrificed items for every category is a good goal...Cons-...if the incentives where a bit better.-Despite its improvements over the first version, some things have been nerfed negatively (heal has a super long delay, refinement stones can only be acquired via disassembly, some recipes are anubis gated or harder to get, among others)-Battle system still feels clunky.-Physics still have many problems and you can no longer do some things that you could before effectively (the farm stack works, but it may clip on the ground, be flown way by fans or conveyors, etc).-Goddawful character creation options: extremely limited amount of faces, hairstyles,etc. For a game that brags on world customization, its pretty limited on this department.-No Story, pretty much. No ""real"" characters to interact, no real motive for adventuring/surviving, other than ""oops, i did a bubu""-NPCs look a bit better, but still are lifeless drones. At least they no longer poop in place. Or maybe they do.-Just one Island with many biomes. I preferred having multiple islands with their respective biome.Neutral= Is it wrong if i prefer some of the older ""puzzle"" or challenge type dungeons from the previous release?= Where is the log guy? I want to give him a log.Just like my review, Craftopia is all over the place, but i feel confident that you may find somewhat you may like so, even with all its flaws, i can recommend it, as long as you don't have high expectations.Either making a farm and forgetting about adventure, wandering around and finding stuff, crafting stuff to infinity, or making the sky castle you always wanted.Do whatever and poop wherever you want.",Recommended,3299,481.1 hrs on record,Posted: March 20
"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI do not understand how this is mostly positive. Its buggy, performs poorly and has been in early access for years. I picked this up when it first became available on steam and its some how gotten worse over time. They've copied more from botw for no reason like the starting area being a platue, the musical jingles and a lot of enemies are heavily based in botw enemies the most obvious being the 'goblins' which are clearly bokolins.Game needs some SERIOUSLY TLC and at this point Im not sure it can walk back all the botw 'inspiration' enough to make the game its own thing.The game also just runs very poorly with frame drops, getting stuck on terrain, game crashes and enemies/creatures clearly moving at lower frames then everything else.",Not Recommended,632,7.0 hrs on record,Posted: March 18
"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWGame worked fine but now doesn't work even though I meet the minimum system requirements. Game is not optimized well for lower-end PCs.

"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAfter an announcement made in the Palworld Discord about Craftopia I decided to check out some gameplays and give it a shot. I actually like Craftopia more than I like Palworld. It just, feels better to play and somehow it doesn't feel repetitive. After playing multiple runthroughs with Palworld (which I also like) I find myself preferring Craftopia because Palworld gets boring once its time to level up endgame pals. I just gave up because the condenser requires just too much and I lost interest. Building in PAlworld was also too limited. While the interface of Craftopia is similar, the gameplay focuses on crafting rather than catching pals. I love crafting when its worth it. Craftopia makes it worth it.

"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThe translations are comedy gold. Guess they couldn't find one person that speaks English. Here is a selection of fish:Giant Trevally - Is exactly exile who like to taste alone swim there as lonely at large. Sessha the giant trevally. The bamboo basket is flowing.Blue Turtle - Is a turtle to live longer a huge, is a valuable meat eaten by the sea. Eggs gave birth in tears also be eaten.Shrimp - Some large varieties to eat to capture the tiger called black tiger.Koi Fish - Greed in consuming eat everything, but easy to the minute fishing. Gory need people time to eat for.The developer put out a statement today to reassure gamers that the success of Palworld won't take away from the development of Craftopia as they are developed by separate teams.Let me translate the above: Don't worry, the developers that actually know what they are doing won't touch this game. It will stay with the same team that sat on this bugfest for years.In terms of updates, the Seamless update (which took 2 years to release) gutted most of the content. The Seamless update released 9 months ago. The update this week finally restored the last Evolution Age that was gutted by the Seamless update and existed 3 years ago.I'm rating this up, because I had fun messing around in coop. However, the game is still full of bugs and has a terrible performance. The moment you set up any automation, the FPS tanks. I ended up watching a slide show again today when my FPS fell to 9 on my RTX 3080 at 1440p.",Recommended,1237,221.4 hrs on record,Posted: March 16

"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThe translations are comedy gold. Guess they couldn't find one person that speaks English. Here is a selection of fish:Giant Trevally - Is exactly exile who like to taste alone swim there as lonely at large. Sessha the giant trevally. The bamboo basket is flowing.Blue Turtle - Is a turtle to live longer a huge, is a valuable meat eaten by the sea. Eggs gave birth in tears also be eaten.Shrimp - Some large varieties to eat to capture the tiger called black tiger.Koi Fish - Greed in consuming eat everything, but easy to the minute fishing. Gory need people time to eat for.The developer put out a statement today to reassure gamers that the success of Palworld won't take away from the development of Craftopia as they are developed by separate teams.Let me translate the above: Don't worry, the developers that actually know what they are doing won't touch this game. It will stay with the same team that sat on this bugfest for years.In terms of updates, the Seamless update (which took 2 years to release) gutted most of the content. The Seamless update released 9 months ago. The update this week finally restored the last Evolution Age that was gutted by the Seamless update and existed 3 years ago.I'm rating this up, because I had fun messing around in coop. However, the game is still full of bugs and has a terrible performance. The moment you set up any automation, the FPS tanks. I ended up watching a slide show again today when my FPS fell to 9 on my RTX 3080 at 1440p.",Recommended,1237,221.4 hrs on record,Posted: March 16

"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis game is still Early Access. There is quite of content in game considering it's development stage,The game is not optimsed. I play on an high end rig, which most people don't. I have had a few glitches and discovered a really annoying bug, where trying to place work benches down or other benches, it just wouldn't work.It is quite enjoyable and graphics are very beautiful. Many of the quests make absolutely no sense, simply because there is no real in game tutorial and what their is woefully under done. If your thinking of buying and playing this, this game is still in developed. Fixing bugs such the one I mentioned that after a while you can' see to place any thing, which does break the game in the sense that without the crafting tables you've made, you get to a play point in the game where it just stops you from placing anything on the ground.The main thing is the development team have split in half so they do this game and another relatively well known game. I have no interest in advertising their other game but its very easy to find, that is all I m going to say about that.The game play really doesn't play, since it has some major functions that the game is still lacking. Bare in mind I am referring to single player mode only. I imagine the devs would have more incentive to a number of problems, they maybe did't think would be a problem or it could be fixed quickly, well it hasn't so far.Right now, I would wait for the game to get it's main stuff put in to the game, for example the rest of the towers. The vehicles in this game don't work too well, very little thought went to drive able or flyable. Driving is just a dreadful experience at the moment. Kite flying is quite smooth, no problems with it.let me just partially list some of the bad things, its not exhaustive but I don't to be here all night either writing a review on a game that still feels like it is still in late alpha build, as for beta, despite the size of the game right now, it's meaningless when there is no game manual that tells you how to use some of the stuff and how to play the game.Needs some things to be adjusted.Graphics are beautiful, the game play smoothly for me, apart from the annoying bugs that forced me to stop playing. I played 3 hours, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.Cons - No voice acting, no npc helping you fight monsters (at least in Genshin Impact had multiple characters you use anyone time.) The NPC's really need to be livened up somewhat. They don't seem to communicate with each other, or start up random conversations. For me NPC interaction with each other is vital because it stops the world becoming bore fest. It would also be nice if we could befriend and npc, so we can go monster killing, item collecting etc. It wouldn't matter in multiplayer, but in single player, without interaction the game world feels utterly dead. Hence other developers have had to learn the long way However that isn't the word I was shooting for.A full written guide is absolutely needed. I am sure ALL the bugs will be fixed in time. But the biggest bug that stopped me playing, was suddenly unable to place any type of workbench etc on the ground. Then is the badly janky driving, either airplanes, bikes or cars. However that Jankiness is just terrible. I want a smooth drive, without having to auto crash into walls..it's also got another bug, where when you get off your motorbike which is where we immediately get to work, laIf your on the fence about buying this game. wait for it on steam sale.

If I had to go back and pick between which one to play again it would be craftopia. Pal World was an over night hit, but Ill be honest I had to stop. It was less fun than craftopia for me. Palworld has a problem: Lack of story.Im more of an rpg gamer to be honest... I play a title to the end (or until i get bored) and I move to the next. Gaming is my version of reading books.

"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWMy PC is more than capable, yet the game performs as if i am using a potato. The bike is extremely janky and handles terribly.

"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThe game has been in early access for a while now and seems to be in a very alpha state still. A lot of things are missing, broken, buggy, and quite frankly the game is a mess. There is fun to be had but a lot of jank as well. Right now I would give this a hard pass as it is not worth your gaming dollar and there are other games to play or spend the money on. Also, at the current rate of development the game might never be finished or be left in a broken buggy mess of a state as it is now.",Not Recommended,405,43.5 hrs on record,Posted: February 15

Unfortunately, the reality of it is that they wasted large amounts of development time making the game different than when I bought it (and not in the more content way), made the game run considerably worse, removed vast swaths of content, reimplemented existing content but made it worse, no building things like floors and farming plots without snapping (sorry if you picked up a plot in the starting area and want to place it in its original spot, or build in certain cool places. No free placement for you, only snapped to a grid, and only able to turn things 45 degrees), hitboxes are so bad that it oftentimes takes several swings of a sword to get a single hit on something directly in front of you, and overall, just made the game less enjoyable to play. Additionally, while trying to find more information about this update, I found that the person in charge of moderating the Steam discussions seems to enjoy nuking topics about the game that aren't singing its praises, criticizes customers for daring to speak negatively about the game, and considers the opinions of users that have complaints or concerns ""useless.""Really enjoying the game PocketPair is likely better known for now, Palworld, and am hoping they continue to improve it, but after returning to this game after a long break, it's even made me concerned about that game as well (even though I've already gotten a good amount of fun out of Palworld).

You can spend a lot of time building up and i wouldn't really call it a grind game.Really happy about the recent updates and they have been updating all along.

"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWIn my opinion, does not deserve the review bombing that its getting due to the release of Palworld.People don't seem to understand that the dev team is split and that they are proving that this won't be abandoned. Its also very clear what they are going for. Palworld is Pokemon Arceus, this is BOTW complete with challenge shrines/korok seed challenges, puzzle caves and towers that you unlock through crafting to fast travel from. Palworld is also much more early access than this. This has much more content, less dead map, and overall a bit more to it. You also have robots that basically do the animals job. The game is also relatively relaxing whilst allowing for semi complex, logic based automation with conveyor belts and/or mass farming, which, I'm a sucker for actual automation and conveyor belts.It's admittedly a little clunkier than PW from what I've seen but it's not a huge fallback. World feels well crafted, there are caves, puzzles, a huge array of animals, bosses, vehicles, weapons, armour and I enjoy the aspect of 'recreating earth', eventually finding villages that have electricity etc, very cool. And eventually the supposed ability to tame a literal God, though I personally haven't done this yet, just heard through the grapevine.Overall, the success of PW makes me hope that this gives them even more resources to make both games great in their own unique ways. I've seen a vast improvement to Craftopia over the years and I'm very much enjoying where its at at the moment. One thing people are also missing is that PW wasn't developed over night, they have proven they are capable on working on both projects by working on both projects in tandem. It also has a very public, promising roadmap that I suggest checking out if you are concerned and the updates are generally plentiful and overall fun.",Recommended,1536,20.3 hrs on record,Posted: January 31
"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWok, i am actually going to change my review completely, leaving the bottom part because it is still funny.there is a metaphor regularly used known as the ship of theseus. the story boils down to determining whether or not an object can still be regarded as the original object as it was at creation when time goes on and the parts of the object are replaced. this game is like if many popular games decided to have their parts taken out in exchange for other mechanics/concepts, then this game took those mechanics and built a new ship out of them. much of this ship comes from the game the legend of zelda breathe of the wild, but there are some similar themes from other games. the obvious parts that feel directly taken are things like the stamina meter, which works extremely similarly to botw, and the paraglider mechanics. ironically, this game has directly had many ship of theseus moments, especially with the island to seamless map change. and this where i can directly trace a similar concept taken from a different game to craftopia: certain environments. there is a large area that was implemented with the seamless world that is not necessarily stolen, but seems rather heavily inspired by elden ring; the area is a huge castle with a huge golden tree in the middle. additionally, if you thought that palworld copied pokemon, i regret to inform you that this game was the original game where pocketpair copied the creature capturing game. while it is not a stolen concept to have the player be able to capture creatures and let them do your bidding, this game's implementation of the mechanic does mirror pokemon quite a bit, with the player having to damage the enemies then capture them with a pokeball-like item. again, i am not trying to say that this game is directly copying other games. much of this is just inspiration: the inside of the elden ring-like fortress is unlike the actual elden ring capital city, some of the creatures in this game cannot be captured without utilizing certain items, and even the botw parts can be seen as different because of the inclusion of an upgradeable mana bar. i am just pointing out that this game is a smorgasbord of other games that needs to be polished more in all those aspects. i hope that the item descriptions become more descriptive, the game performance becomes more optimized, and the enemy diversity becomes more wild (so that i can capture them because even the most bare bones pokemon concept beats out real pokemon).TL:DR: this game really takes from a heap of other games, not just breathe of the wild, but i hope it still grows.edit: if you like shiny achievements, almost every achievement in this game is rare since achievements were added later, meaning that players who get them now will be in the rare percentile that actually returned/just got the game",Recommended,2358,59.0 hrs on record,Posted: January 30

"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI would like to start this review by stating the fact that I did enjoy my time playing Craftopia and got it way back when during the early days of release, but it was just a major let down whenever the updates stopped rolling out.It probably should have been red flags to me whenever they said the team was going to be developing another game while Craftopia was still being early access. This didn't really phase me too much because I trusted the size of the developer team and the scale of the game and was hopeful they stuck with their promise of having Craftopia updates along side the new game known to everyone as ""Palworld"". All of the faith I had in the company quickly disappeared as soon as I saw the number of people purchasing and playing their new game and making it one of the biggest hits on steam rivaling some of the most popular games within just a few days of release. Was this a problem? No. I am glad the company struck gold and is making profits where they earned it. Was this a huge concern of mine? Yes. This means the game they released prior to Palworld loses all of its value and goes right out of the window because they now have this giant cash cow that prints money and the developers would like to retain and further obtain players. What does this mean for Craftopia? It will get way less updates if none at all (which it currently has had zero proper major updates since seamless came out). Again it is still early access, but people that purchase a game in this state expects some sort of attention to the game in the form of updates even if they are a few months apart and not over a year. But who knows maybe Palworld will actually get constant updates because it has so many eyes on it vs Craftopia.In conclusion:Please do NOT buy this game if you are expecting it to be updated further than it currently is and if you are playing the older version (pre-seamless) I recommend playing that version of the game because it has WAY more content in it than the current version (Seamless stripped away so much of the content in the prior update that they went from 7/10 progress all the way back down to 2/10 for terms of quality content).",Not Recommended,1782,224.2 hrs on record,Posted: January 25
