"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWGame is really good mostly with friends also as a solo it's tough but fun. It's a loot extraction game with a very small learning curve that does ramp up slightly at harder moons. Game also feels very casual which is nice you aren't forced to grind out anything except a few ship upgrades early game but those mostly just add qol rather than a must have immediately.One thing i will say that is terrible about this game is public lobbies. I'd say about 30% of the public lobby players are cheaters some do it blatantly and some not like i had one guy flying through the walls when we weren't around and extracting tons of loot ended up seeing him in death cam then I had another guy join our pretty progressed save as a random 4th and he waited for quota day and deleted all the items in the ship. I also had a player join and flip the monitor and storage unit on its side which was not fixable without cheats. Also nothing is done at all to combat cheaters in this game since it's a small dev team and a non competitive casual game which I get it that's exactly why people cheat but honestly after seeing it even a few times it gets old and kinda ruins the multiplayer experience which is one of the better aspects of this game.Another problem with the game is the amount of trolls out of the 70% non cheaters expect about 4/5 of these other randoms to be complete trolls anything from turning the lights of and hiding the light switch to blaring music in their microphone or loud noises. These are easy enough to deal with as you can mute players but there are also items in the game that turn you into a mimic which can throw your whole run and weapons which allow players to come in and kill everyone in the lobby.TLDR GOOD GAME, AVOID PLAYING WITH RANDOM PEOPLE, GOOD ENTRY LEVEL GAME FOR LOOT EXTRACTION GENRE.",Recommended,1492,39.9 hrs on record,Posted: April 5

"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWLethal Company: A Searing Indictment of Western Exploitation Disguised as EntertainmentAt first glance, ""Lethal Company"" may seem like just another science fiction game, but upon closer examination, it reveals a disturbing truth about the insidious nature of Western exploitation. The game's premise of scavenging for resources on distant planets for a mysterious company speaks volumes about the predatory practices of Western corporations, which exploit vulnerable populations and ravage the environment in pursuit of profit.What sets ""Lethal Company"" apart is its unflinching portrayal of the human cost of such exploitation. As players navigate the treacherous landscapes of these distant planets, they are confronted with the grim reality of forced labor, environmental destruction, and systemic oppression perpetrated by the eponymous company. This stark depiction serves as a poignant reminder of the atrocities committed by Western powers in their relentless quest for dominance.Moreover, the game's narrative challenges players to question their own complicity in these injustices. By assuming the role of employees of the lethal company, players are forced to confront the moral implications of their actions, ultimately leading to a reckoning with the consequences of their choices. This powerful message resonates deeply with those of us who refuse to turn a blind eye to the suffering inflicted upon marginalized communities by Western exploitation.In conclusion, ""Lethal Company"" stands as a damning indictment of Western imperialism and corporate greed. Its harrowing portrayal of human rights abuses serves as a wake-up call to those who would seek to profit at the expense of others. As Chinese nationalists, we must stand in solidarity with all oppressed peoples and continue to expose the injustices perpetuated by Western powers. Only then can we truly achieve a world free from exploitation and oppression.",Not Recommended,1661,51.3 hrs on record,Posted: April 5
